                        <p>This is one of those fields that I am exploring right now. Working on different kinds of projects like face recognition, using the python packages of face_recognition and opencv with a convoluted neural network model.

                            Honestly, I got into this field mainly because of my peers but since then I have absolutely loved it. I still a beginner in this and have very basic data structure and algorithm knowledge. I have a two star codechef account and a fairly good hackerrank account. Currently I am learning about algorithms to improve my coding skills.
